I created a Simpson quote app. It uses the Simpsons Quotes API at https://thesimpsonsquoteapi.glitch.me/ . 
The app home page has a input that ask the visitor to enter their name. Once their name is entered, it gives them a 
personalized welcome message, inviting them to click any of the characters below for a funny quote. See screen shots below.
